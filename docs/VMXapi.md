# VMX API

VMX runs as a server and processes object detection requests over HTTP.

---

By default, VMX runs on port 3000.  If running locally, the address of
VMX will be `http://localhost:3000` and if running remotely, the
address will be something like `http://192.168.1.134:3000` where the
IP address points to your server. If you're running on a vision.ai
hosted machine which uses https, the address will be something like
`https://demo.vision.ai/`, without the port.

## VMX REST API

The VMX REST API allows you to send commands to VMX to create new
detection processes, perform object detection, create new models, as
well as return the images inside a model's training set. The input and
outputs are always in JSON format (unless specified otherwise).

VERB    | Route   | Description

GET  | /model   |  List available models
POST | /session |  Create a new session
PUT  | /model   |  Save the model

GET  | /models/#ModelId/data_set/random.jpg | Return random image in model

#### Using curl and jq

To use the VMX REST API from the command line, we will be using `curl`
to send/receive requests and `jq` to render the resulting JSONs with
color. Your system should already have curl installed, and jq can be
downloaded from
[http://stedolan.github.io/jq/](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Example 1: Check the number of models and sessions

In this example, we will use the command line to check the number of
models as well as the number of open sessions.  We will then create a
new session with the model called "eyes", detect these objects
in a single image, and then shut down the session.

**Command line input**
```
curl http://localhost:3000/model | jq .
```

**Output**
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "image": "models/008db1b3-acd3-49fe-94ea-a51297926ada/image.jpg",
      "history": [],
      "num_pos": 1000,
      "num_neg": 462,
      "size": [
        10,
        8
      ],
      "uuid": "008db1b3-acd3-49fe-94ea-a51297926ada",
      "name": "hoc_faces",
      "start_time": "2015-04-14T06:04:23.684Z",
      "end_time": "2015-04-14T06:42:57.985Z",
      "meta": ""
    },
    {
      "image": "models/05883a2b-c2f8-4cc9-bdc3-a17dd38e7c6f/image.jpg",
      "history": [],
      "num_pos": 100,
      "num_neg": 200,
      "size": [
        10,
        8
      ],
      "uuid": "05883a2b-c2f8-4cc9-bdc3-a17dd38e7c6f",
      "name": "joker",
      "start_time": "2015-03-27T02:00:51.784Z",
      "end_time": "2015-04-13T08:29:21.932Z",
      "meta": ""
    }
  ...
```

This output can become quite long. To quickly count the number of
available models from the command line, you can simply use the jq JSON
command line processor as follows:

**Command line input**
```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/model | jq '.data | length'
```

**Output**
```
64
```

Let's now check the number of running VMX sessions:

**Command line input**
```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/session | jq '.data | length'
```

**Output**
```
0
```

We have 64 models, but no loaded sessions, so let's create a new
session by POSTing to /session.

## Example 2: Load "eyes" model and get detections

Let's first find the UUID of the
model corresponding to the name "eyes". You can manually inspect
the returned JSON, or use jq to find the data element with the
matching name.

**Command line input**
```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/model | jq -r '.data[] | select(.name=="eyes") .uuid'
```

**Output**
```
e018112b-c9ba-437f-959d-49280acb8c9c
```

UUIDs are unique and assigned to object models at creation time, so
your personal model library will have different UUIDs.  ***Note:*** If
you are showing 0 models, then you'll need to create some using the
VMX GUI.

Let's create a new VMX session with this model UUID.

**Command line input**
```
curl -X POST -d '{"uuids":["e018112b-c9ba-437f-959d-49280acb8c9c"]}' http://localhost:3000/session
```

The output will give us a new session id.

**Output**
```
{ "data": {
    "id": "15c3a5dc-cffb-43ac-a5dd-6755f5376c81"
  }
}
```

We can now verify that the number of sessions is 1.

**Command line input**
```
curl -s localhost:3000/session | jq .
```

**Output**
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "model": {
        "image": "models/e018112b-c9ba-437f-959d-49280acb8c9c/image.jpg",
        "num_pos": 882,
        "num_neg": 360,
        "size": [
          4,
          10
        ],
        "uuid": "e018112b-c9ba-437f-959d-49280acb8c9c",
        "name": "eyes",
        "start_time": "2015-03-16T04:29:36.921Z",
        "end_time": "2015-04-15T07:36:46.837Z"
      },
      "id": "61634995-b25c-4271-b1e5-d3925f49957f"
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's now send an image URL to this VMX session and get the results of
the "eyes" detection. We will be using the following image:

[http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg)

<img src="/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg"></img>

**Command line input**
``` 
curl -s -X POST -d '{"images":[{"image":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg"}]}' localhost:3000/session/15c3a5dc-cffb-43ac-a5dd-6755f5376c81
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "message": "Process Image Success",
  "time": 0.194657229,
  "model": {
    "uuid": "e018112b-c9ba-437f-959d-49280acb8c9c",
    "name": "eyes",
    "size": [
      4,
      10
    ],
    "num_pos": 882,
    "num_neg": 360,
    "start_time": "2015-03-16T04:29:36.921Z",
    "end_time": "2015-04-15T07:36:46.837Z",
    "image": "models/e018112b-c9ba-437f-959d-49280acb8c9c/image.jpg"
  },
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "eyes",
      "bb": [
        103.7099005310307,
        172.78516300280293,
        274.2637297891478,
        242.85019767944317
      ],
      "score": 8.147063606844702
    }
  ]
}
```

If you want to use different detection parameters, you can specify the
`params` fields in the payload as follows:

**Input**
```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"images":[{"image":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg"}],"params":{"crop_radius":80,"crop_threshold":-1,"display_threshold":-1,"jpeg_quality":1,"remove_smooth_below_threshold":true,"display_top_detection":false,"max_windows":100,"learn_mode":false,"learn_iterations":10,"learn_threshold":0,"train_max_positives":2000,"train_max_negatives":1000,"detect_max_overlap":0.1,"learn_max_positives":1,"detect_add_flip":false,"levels_per_octave":10,"max_image_size":320,"initialize_max_cells":12,"cell_size":4,"initialize_add_flip":false}}' localhost:3000/session/15c3a5dc-cffb-43ac-a5dd-6755f5376c81
```

In this example, we created a new VMX session with the "eyes"
detector, sent it the location of an image, and obtained the resulting
JSON which shows the location of the object as well as the resulting
confidence score.

Let's now close our running session.

## Example 3: Close a running session

Let's check the number of running sessions:

**Input**
```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/session | jq '.data | length'
```

**Command line output**
```
1
```

Let's get the session id of the first and only running session.

```
SID=`curl -s http://localhost:3000/session | jq -r '.data[0].id'`
```
And finally let's close the session by sending the DELETE verb to the
session we assigned to the environment variable $SID.

```
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/session/$SID
```

We can now confirm that the number of sessions is 0.

**Input**
```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/session | jq '.data | length'
```

**Command line output**
```
0
```

**Note:** It is sometimes easier to use the GUI for closing
  sessions. You can access the session listing page by visiting
  `http://localhost:3000/#/sessions` which will list the sessions, and
  allow you to close them one by one.

## VMXserver single process API

Inside of VMX there is a collection of separate VMXserver
processes. Each unique session id refers to a separate VMX process --
some of them could be used for detecting cars, and some for detecting
faces.

With the VMX REST API you can launches separate "VMXserver" processes,
but you can start a single VMXserver process on your own. **Note that
the VMXserver API is different than the VMX REST API.**

Even though the VMXserver application interface is a full-fledged API,
it is not a REST-API and lacks multi-session support.  Things are
likely to change in upcoming releases, so it is better to write
applications on top of the REST API and not on top of the VMXserver
single process API.

The VMXserver API currently consists of the following 11 functions:


Command      | Description
-------------| ----------
list_models  |  List currently available models
load_model   |  Load a model
create_model |  Create a model from bounding boxes
save_model   |  Saves a model
process_image | Performs detection or learning on a new image
show_model   |  Show the model's positives and negatives
edit_model   |  Edit the model's positives and negatives and perform learning
get_params   |  Retrieve the process's detection parameters
get_config   |  Get the configuration object
set_config   |  Set the configuration object
exit         |  Stop the VMX server and clean up session

## Example 4: Launch a VMXserver process

Let's launch a VMXserver process on port 8081, using
`/Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/assets` as our main vmx data
directory, assign the process a session id called `my_session`, omit
loading a model on launch by specifying `none` for the model_id, and specify `:8081` to
run on port 8081.

**Input (Mac OS X)**

```
cd /Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/VMXserver.app/Contents/MacOS
./VMXserver /Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/assets my_session none :8081
```

**Input (Linux)**

```
cd ~/vmx-docker-manager/
./vmx start_process 8081
```


**Output**
```

```

In a separate terminal, let's ping VMX server which should be on port 8081.

**Input**

```
curl -s -X POST localhost:8081 | jq .
```

**Output**

```
{
  "error": 1,
  "message": "Invalid json: \"\"",
  "commands": [
    "exit",
    "get_config",
    "set_config",
    "show_model",
    "load_model",
    "list_models",
    "save_model",
    "edit_model",
    "create_model",
    "get_params",
    "process_image"
  ]
}
```

Since we POSTed an empty request, we get an "Invalid json" error, but
at least we know `http://localhost:8081` is ready for commands.

## Example 5: List models and shut down

Let's list some models, and shut down our session.

**Input**

```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"list_models"}' localhost:8081 | jq .
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "uuids": [
    "008db1b3-acd3-49fe-94ea-a51297926ada",
    "05883a2b-c2f8-4cc9-bdc3-a17dd38e7c6f"
  ],
  "names": [
    "hoc_faces",
    "joker"
  ],
  "message": "Listing 2 models"
}
```

We listed `2` models and have both their uuids and names
accessible. Let's now exit the session.

**Input**

```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"exit"}' localhost:8081 | jq .
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "message": "exit"
}
```

Let's now confirm that VMXserver shut down correctly.
 
**Input**
```
curl -X POST localhost:8081
```

**Output**
```
curl: (7) Failed connect to localhost:8081; Connection refused
```

We can see that the VMXserver running on port 8081 did, in fact, shut down.

## Other commands

#### Listing models

The command `list_models` will return a listing of UUIDs inside the
current VMX directory.

**Input**
```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"list_models"}' localhost:8081 | jq .
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "uuids": [
    "008db1b3-acd3-49fe-94ea-a51297926ada",
    "05883a2b-c2f8-4cc9-bdc3-a17dd38e7c6f"
  ],
  "names": [
    "hoc_faces",
    "joker"
  ],
  "message": "Listing 2 models"
}
```


#### Loading a model

To load a model or a set of models, you need a list of UUIDs. In the
context of loading models, a UUID can be either a uuid string, the
absolute file location to a model.data file on local disk, or a remote
URL (must start with http).

A model can be loaded in the `compiled:true` state, which has a reduced
memory footprint and performs detection a little bit faster than the
uncompiled one.  However, a `compiled` model cannot go into learning
mode, so beware.  To enable, set the `compiled` field to true.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["UUID1"],"compiled":false}' localhost:8081
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["UUID1","UUID2"],"compiled":true}' localhost:8081
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["/incoming/model.data"],"compiled":false}' localhost:8081
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["http://vision.ai/uuid1/model.data"],"compiled":false}' localhost:8081
```

#### Creating a Model

To create a new model, we simply send a sequence of images with
annotated bounding boxes, the name of the new model, as well as model
parameters.

**Input**
```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"create_model","name":"thingy","images":[{"image":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg","time":"2015-06-05T20:05:00.295Z","objects":[{"bb":[10,10,60,60],"name":"thingy"}]}],"params":{"train_max_positives":1000,"cell_size":4,"learn_iterations":10,"max_image_size":640,"display_top_detection":false,"initialize_max_cells":10,"crop_radius":80,"max_windows":100,"learn_threshold":0,"train_max_negatives":2000,"remove_smooth_below_threshold":true,"jpeg_quality":1,"display_threshold":0,"initialize_add_flip":false,"detect_add_flip":false,"learn_max_positives":1,"levels_per_octave":10,"detect_max_overlap":0.1,"learn_mode":false,"crop_threshold":0}}'
localhost:8081 | jq .
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "message": "Create Model Success (UUID=thingy)",
  "warning": "Create Model (Model Not Saved)",
  "data": {
    "model": {
      "uuid": "26156022-0eae-4eca-bf92-761db2d650cb",
      "name": "thingy",
      "size": [
        10,
        10
      ],
      "num_pos": 1,
      "num_neg": 4,
      "start_time": "2015-06-05T20:05:00.295Z",
      "end_time": "2015-06-05T20:05:00.295Z",
      "image": "models/26156022-0eae-4eca-bf92-761db2d650cb/image.jpg"
    },
    "time": 10.253389608
  }
}
```

Note that the model is not saved immediately after creation. You can
also use the default parameters for model creation by simply omitting
the "params" field:

**Input**
```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"create_model","name":"thingy","images":[{"image":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg","time":"2015-06-05T20:05:00.295Z","objects":[{"bb":[10,10,60,60],"name":"thingy"}]}]}' localhost:8081
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "message": "Create Model Success (UUID=thingy)",
  "warning": "Create Model (Model Not Saved)",
  "data": {
    "model": {
      "uuid": "bf940050-9bf9-4361-91e3-a1890aa85559",
      "name": "thingy",
      "size": [
        10,
        10
      ],
      "num_pos": 1,
      "num_neg": 10,
      "start_time": "2015-06-05T20:05:00.295Z",
      "end_time": "2015-06-05T20:05:00.295Z",
      "image": "models/bf940050-9bf9-4361-91e3-a1890aa85559/image.jpg"
    },
    "time": 9.822247472
  }
}
```

#### Saving a model
When no model_name is specified, it will use the current name assigned
to the model.  A new model_name can be provided, which will the save
the model with this new name and return a new model with the name updated.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"save_model","model_name":"new_model"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Processing an image (detecting objects)

To perform object detection, you can use the process_image
command. This will use the currently loaded model (or set of models),
perform the computationally expensive object detection procedure, and
then return a set of bounding boxes associated with the image.  You
can set the input image as either dataURLS, absolute file locations on
disk (works in Mac), or URLs. This should give you enough
flexibility to run VMX in many different interesting scenarios.

The input to `process_image` also takes a params object.

**Input**
```
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"process_image","images":[{"image":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tomasz/img/tomasz_blue_crop.jpg"}]}' localhost:8081
```

**Output**
```
{
  "error": 0,
  "message": "Process Image Success",
  "time": 0.295668743,
  "model": {
    "uuid": "07eb4e84-eb8a-42f5-8eda-1b00429f90a4",
    "name": "thingy",

      10,
      10
    ],
    "num_pos": 1,

#### Showing a model

Showing a model consists of extracting images for the postive and
negative examples used in the underlying machine learning model.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -d '{"command":"show_model","settings":{"learn_iterations":10,"max_positives":10,"max_negatives":10,"positives_order":-1,"negatives_order":1},"changes":[]}' localhost:8081
```

#### Editing a model

Editing a model consists of re-assigning negatives to the positive
class, removing negatives, re-assigning positives to the negative
class, or removing negatives.  After these swaps, learning is
performed for a few iterations, and this process can be repeated
indefinitely.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"edit_model",...}' localhost:8081
```

#### Getting detection params

You can query the current detection params.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"get_params"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Getting the config object

The config object is used for controlling debug parameters of
VMXserver (the contents of `config.json`) programmatically.  You can
get the config object as follows:

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"get_config"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Setting the config object
```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"set_config","log_images":"true"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Shutting down VMX server

There is a simple command which lets you shut down a VMX session and
free up memory on your machine.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"exit"}' localhost:8081
```

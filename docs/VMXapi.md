## VMXserver API

VMX typically launches separate "VMXserver" processes to manage
multiple sessions, but you can start a standalone VMXserver process on
your own.

The VMXServer application interface is the way your application or
script talks to our system.  Even though the VMXserver application
interface is a full-fledged API, it is not a REST-API and lacks
multi-session support.  Things are likely to change in upcoming
releases, so it is better to write applications on top of the REST API
and not on top of the application interface.

The VMXserver application interface describes how to interact with a
single VMX object detection `process`.  The API currently consists of
the following 11 functions:


Command      | Description
-------------| ----------
list_models  |  List currently available models
load_model   |  Load a model
create_model |  Create a model from bounding boxes
save_model   |  Saves a model
process_image | Performs detection or learning on a new image
show_model   |  Show the model's positives and negatives
edit_model   |  Edit the model's positives and negatives and perform learning
get_params   |  Retrieve the process's detection parameters
get_config   |  Get the configuration object
set_config   |  Set the configuration object
exit         |  Stop the VMX server and clean up sessions

You issue these commands by writing a command json into the VMXserver
port.  The format of the command json is as
follows:

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["UUID1"],"compiled",false}' localhost:8081
```
Where ... corresponds to additional arguments that are required to
make sense of the command.  Here is a short description of each of
these functions.

#### Listing models

The command `list_models` will return a listing of UUIDs inside the
current VMX directory.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"save_model","model_name":"new_model"}'
```

#### Loading a model

To load a model or a set of models, you need a list of UUIDs. In the
context of loading models, a UUID can be either a uuid string, the
absolute file location to a model.data file on local disk, or a remote
URL (must start with http).

A model can be loaded in the `compiled:true` state, which has a reduced
memory footprint and performs detection a little bit faster than the
uncompiled one.  However, a `compiled` model cannot go into learning
mode, so beware.  To enable, set the `compiled` field to true.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["UUID1"],"compiled":false}' localhost:8081
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["UUID1","UUID2"],"compiled":true}' localhost:8081
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["/incoming/model.data"],"compiled":false}' localhost:8081
curl -X POST -d '{"command":"load_model","uuids":["http://vision.ai/uuid1/model.data"],"compiled":false}' localhost:8081
```

#### Creating a Model
To create a new model, we simply send a sequence of images with
bounding boxes, and the name of the new model name (`cls` in this case).

```json
{ "command" : "create_model" , "selections" :
[{"image" : "image1.jpg" , "bb" : [10,10,10,100] , "time" :
"2014-09-09T3:43.003Z", "cls" : "new_object"}]}
```

#### Saving a model
When no model_name is specified, it will use the current name assigned
to the model.  A new model_name can be provided, which will the save
the model with this new name and return a new model with the name updated.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"save_model","model_name":"new_model"}'
```

#### Processing an image (detecting objects)

To perform object detection, you simply call process_image. Process
Image will return a set of bounding boxes associated with the image.
You can set images as either dataURLS, absolute file locations on
disk, or remote URLs.  This should give you enough flexibility to run
VMX in many different interesting scenarios.

The input to `process_image` also takes a params object.

```sh
{"command":"process_image","images":[{"image":"/VMXdata/first.jpg"}]}
```

#### Showing a model

Showing a model consists of extracting images for the postive and
negative examples used in the underlying machine learning model.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"show_model",...}' localhost:8081
```

#### Editing a model

Editing a model consists of re-assigning negatives to the positive
class, removing negatives, re-assigning positives to the negative
class, or removing negatives.  After these swaps, learning is
performed for a few iterations, and this process can be repeated
indefinitely.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"edit_model",...}' localhost:8081
```

#### Getting detection params

You can query the current detection params.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"get_params"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Getting the config object

The config object is used for controlling debug parameters of
VMXserver (the contents of `config.json`) programmatically.  You can
get the config object as follows:

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"get_config"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Setting the config object
```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"set_config","log_images":"true"}' localhost:8081
```

#### Shutting down VMX server

There is a simple command which lets you shut down a VMX session and
free up memory on your machine.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"command:"exit"}' localhost:8081
```

## VMX Directory Structure

#### Models

In order to recognize something in an image, you need to first learn a
model.  A model is a collection of positive and negative examples used
to describe a visual concept.  Models can be used to detect objects in
images and videos, and one of VMX's key strength is the ability to let
you easily make your own models.  You can use pre-trained models,
interactively re-train existing models, or just train your own by
waving an object in front of your webcam.  VMX can go into "automatic
learning mode", so you can observe the algorithm get better as it is
detecting objects in real-time.  Each model has a human-readable name
(e.g., "dog" or "tom") as well as its own unique birth certificate (we
use a 32 alphanumeric character universally unique identifier, or
UUID, to identify models). Models are stored in a
vmx_dir/models/model_id folder on your hard drive.  Each model also
contains customizable parameters (e.g., "max_image_size",
"detector_quality") which can be modified in real-time to adjust the
speed and performance of the running detector.

Inside each model directory, there is a `model.json` file which
contains meta-data about the model such as its human-readable `name`
(e.g., 'face', 'Tom', or 'left_hand'), a `data_set.json` file which
contains the data set of images and object locations used to train the
model, a `image.jpg` image of the model, a `params.json` file
containing the customizable parameters associated with the model, and
a binary file `model.data` with the internal representation of the
model as used by VMX.

*NOTE*: As you train more and more models, you should backup your models
directory so that you do not lose any of your work.

#### Sessions

Many applications require multiple object detectors, so we've made it
easy to run multiple VMX processes.  Each VMX process can have
different models loaded in memory and can separately go into learning
mode.  A session directory is created for each running VMXserver
process.  Sessions are referred to by UUIDs, and local session
information is stored in a sessions/session_id folder on local disk.
Local session information consists of a file
`sessions/session_id/model.json` which stores the information about
the models loaded into the session `session_id`.  The session
directory is also where information gets logged, so a
`sessions/session_id/log.txt` file will contain API logs of the VMX
process.

*NOTE*: The more you use VMX, your /sessions/ folder will grow with
longs of old sessions. You should either backup your logs (if you are
debugging your application) or feel free to delete the entire sessions
directory once you've made sure no VMX processes are active.

*NOTE*: The best way to launch main VMX processes is via the REST API
 provided in the VMX package.

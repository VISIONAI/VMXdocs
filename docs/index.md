# Welcome to VMX Docs

The VMX Object Detection Engine comes with a highly-optimized visual
object detection algorithm engineered for speed, accuracy, and
ease-of-use.  VMX lets you quickly train new object models as well use
those models as object detectors for recognizing/localizing/tracking
objects in images and videos. The VMX Engine runs as a server and uses
a simple JSON-based command API so you can build apps in your favorite
programming language as well as interact with VMX over the HTTP
protocol.  For those of you that like cats, awks, and pipes, VMX can
also take commands from standard input (*command line support is
built-in*).

VMX runs on your personal computer, with native installers for Mac OS
X and Linux, as well as a Docker support which supports Windows, Mac
OS X, and Linux.  The VMX package consists of VMX Server, VMX Middle,
and the VMX App Builder.

This readme will first focus on installation/activation, then describe
the available VMX server API commands, and conclude with an overview
how VMX models are organized on your hard drive.

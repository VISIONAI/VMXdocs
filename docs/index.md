Welcome to the VMX Documentation pages.  VMX is a web-based real-time
object detection and recognition system made and maintained by [vision.ai](http://vision.ai).

# About VMX

VMX consists of a visual object detection algorithm engineered for
speed, accuracy, and a web-based interface for building vision
applications.  VMX lets you quickly train new object models and use
those models as object detectors for recognizing, localizing, and
tracking objects in images and videos. The VMX Engine runs as a server
and uses a simple JSON-based command API so you can build apps in your
favorite programming language and talk to VMX over HTTP.  VMX can also
take commands from standard input (*command line support is
built-in*). 

## Learn VMX
The VMX GUI runs in your browser and gives you many powerful tools to
build and prototype your computer vision application. To learn how to
use the VMX GUI, train your own models, and modify existing models,
see [Learn VMX](VMXAppBuilder.md). 

## VMX API
If you want to interface with VMX from your favorite programming
language, build a web-based vision app, or interact with a running VMX
system, see [VMX API Docs](api.md).

## Installation

Installation and deployment instructions are provided in
[VMX Installation Docs](install.md). VMX runs on your personal
computer, with native installers for Mac OS X and Linux, as well as
Docker container support for all three major personal computing
platforms: Windows (via boot2docker), Mac OS X, and Linux.

# VMX Docs

Welcome to the VMX Documentation pages.  VMX is a web-based object
recognition server made by vision.ai, LLC.

# About VMX

VMX consists of a visual object detection algorithm engineered for
speed, accuracy, and a web-based interface for building vision
applications.  VMX lets you quickly train new object models and use
those models as object detectors for recognizing, localizing, and
tracking objects in images and videos. The VMX Engine runs as a server
and uses a simple JSON-based command API so you can build apps in your
favorite programming language and talk to VMX over HTTP.  VMX can also
take commands from standard input (*command line support is
built-in*).  VMX is developed and maintained by
[vision.ai, LLC](http://vision.ai).

VMX runs on your personal computer, with native installers for Mac OS
X and Linux, as well as [Docker](http://www.docker.com) support for
all three major computing platforms: Windows (via
[boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/)), Mac OS X, and Linux.  The
standalone VMX software package consists of three components: VMX
Server, VMX Middle, and the VMX App Builder.

This page focuses on installation and activation. If you're interested
in learning how to use the VMX App Builder GUI, see
[VMX App Builder Docs](VMXAppBuilder.md). To learn about the VMX REST
API and building an application on top of VMX, see
[VMX REST API Docs](VMXmiddle.md). Finally, VMX server internals,
model and session directory structures, and VMX server command-line
interaction is described in [VMX Server Docs](VMXserver.md).

## Installing VMX

You can download a VMX installer for Mac OS X, or use Docker
when using Linux. VMX requires v8.3 of the Matlab Compiler Runtime
(MCR) R2014a -- a separate 1.6GB download from the Mathworks, Inc
website.  When using Docker, all dependencies including the MATLAB MCR
will be automatically downloaded.

##

If you need to download any of the individual VMX components, download
an older version, want to try a bleeding-edge experimental build, or
want to match your download against our MD5 checksums, please visit
[https://files.vision.ai/vmx](https://files.vision.ai/vmx).

### Linux

On Linux, we support a Docker installation.  After Docker is
installed, download vision.ai's <a
href="https://github.com/VISIONAI/vmx-docker-manager">docker
manager</a>.

For example, to start VMX on port 3000:

```
git clone https://github.com/VISIONAI/vmx-docker-manager.git

cd vmx-docker-manager

./vmx start 3000
```

When you run `./vmx init` (or `./vmx start PORT` for the first time),
a docker container with the binaries is started, which creates a
volume at `/vmx/build`

For information on installing docker please see the
[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)

If you choose to install VMX on a Linux machine without Docker, please
refer to our Dockerfiles to see the required packages and libraries.

### boot2docker

[boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) is a lightweight Linux
distribution made specifically to run Docker containers.  It runs
completely from RAM, weight ~27MB and boots in ~5s(YMMV).  This allows
you to run VMX on a Windows computer, as well as provide an
alternative method for installing on a Mac OS X system.

### Default MCR Location

VMX server will look for the MCR inside the following default
locations:

  | 
------- | ---------
Linux    | A volume from visionai/vmxmcr to `/root/MATLAB/`
Mac OS X | `/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/`

##

The MCR field of the VMX `config.json` configuration file (See
[Configuring VMX](VMXserver.md)) points to the MCR directory and can
be set to anything you like if you choose to install the MCR in a
different location.

### Mac OS X notes

On MacOSX, VMX installs into `/Applications/VMX.app/` or
`~/Applications/VMX.app/`. The location of the `VMX binary ` will be
`/Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/` and the location of the `VMX
server binary` will be
`/Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/VMXserer.app/Contents/MacOS/`.

To uninstall in Mac OS X, move the `/Applications/VMX.app` folder into
your Trash.  VMX stores models inside this directory, so be sure to
back up your models before uninstalling.

The Mac OS X installer will use `/tmp/mcr_cache` as the MCR cache
directory.  If you're having issues with installation/activation, make
sure you have read/write permissions for this folder.  You can also
try removing the directory `/tmp/mcr_cache` in the case it gets corrupted.
VMXserver will regenerate a cache directory if it is not present.

To uninstall in Mac OS X, simply remove the /Applications/VMX.app
folder into your Trash.  VMX stores all of its files within this
directory, so be sure to back up your models if you have created any
of your own.

## Activating VMX

To run VMX locally, each VMX installation requires a valid key and an
internet connection to obtain a valid license from the vision.ai
activation server.  Activation is per-machine, and a new key/license
is required for installation on a new machine.  Activation is usually
performed from within the VMX App Builder program, but can also be
done from the command line.  Simply start the VMX application and the
GUI will help you activate the software.  You can visit the
[vision.ai forums](https://forums.vision.ai) if you are having issues
with activation.

A valid VMX beta key corresponding to a personal license can be
purchased from [https://beta.vision.ai](https://beta.vision.ai).
Please see [vision.ai forums](https://forums.vision.ai) to learn how
to be a beta tester.

### Command line activation
Once you've obtained a valid VMX key, you can perform the activation
procedure on the command line:

```sh
cd /Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/VMXserver.app/Contents/MacOS/
./activate.sh key email
```

### Checking the activation

To check the activation, you can either run:

```sh
cd /Applications/VMX.app/Contents/MacOS/VMXserver.app/Contents/MacOS/
./VMXserver -check
```

Or you can visit
[http://localhost:3000/check](http://localhost:3000/check) in your
browser.

## Updating VMX

Your VMX license will work with all 0.x.x releases, leading up to
the 1.0 release. To check for more recent VMX versions, see
[https://files.vision.ai/vmx/](https://files.vision.ai/vmx).  On Mac
OS X, you can download the most recent installer: it will overwrite
the old binaries, automatically transfer over your existing license,
and leave your models intact. To be safe, it is a good idea to backup
your `config.json` file which contains the key and license information
to run future versions of VMX on **your** computer.  When running the
VMX installer a second time, the installer will save your old config
files to `/tmp/vmx_installer.config.json` and
`/tmp/vmx_installer.settings.yml`.
